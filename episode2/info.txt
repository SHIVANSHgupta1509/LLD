procedural programming is less secure as lifetime is very high
arr ko print krne pe uska address nhi milta uska hashcode milta

data members should be private for securoty and member func are public
memory allocated at time of creation of objects not class declaration vo bas text
ki tarah pada code 

Java is always pass by value

func can also return an object

method is vo func jinhe access krne ke liye unka obj banaya jae
so jinke age static hai vo func hai keval.

pure oopl is which has everything has class or obj
but java isnt as isme primitove variables bhi hai
and iska solution Java ne hume wrapper class banake diya
as primitive me null nhi store.
it also gives as autoboxing and unboxing
