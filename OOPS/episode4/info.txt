static variables ko class bnte wakt hi mem mil jat, usse pehle kuch static block hota 
vo chlta.
they dont have to have an obj to be accessed

memory effici is achieved via static data members
and is good ki hume obj banna hi nhi pada jaise Integer.MAX_VALUE ke liye obj nhi
yeh static hoga so dir accessable.
static is lifetime high and security issues 
also not thread safe 

pr agr private rkho to getter likhna hoga, also agr private kroge to getter ko static 
kro tab hi access.

static method can only access other static methods and other static data members as
socho na agr static nhi hai koi data member means vo kisi obj se associated hoga 
and abhi mujhe pta hi nhi obj bana ya nhi ya obj konsa hai.
as hum bina obj ke bhi call ho skte

agr krna hi hai static valo ke andr access to tum uske andr obj bana skte ho 
but uska koi relevance nhi hai.

constructors are not sttaic as they are called when an obj is made, or is obj property
but static is calss property

nested classes are used for strongly coupled classes means ki outer  class ka 
obj banae bina inner class ka obj bnega hi nhi, used only in some cases.

pr agr static banate inner class so hum inner class ka bana skte obj using 
only outer class

static block loading ke time hi chl jata (linking se bi pehle), programm run krne
pe sbse pehle.

agr hume public class rkhni to same name hona chaie class and file ka 
that means ek hi public class ho skti at max, also agr hum public class likh 
rhe so that is entry point for jvm, aur classes bhi hogi and unhe bhi run kr skte

also jab code compile krte ho to jitni classes hai utni hi aur .class file bnti
as socho src code to sara ek file me likh diya but ab compile to alg hoga

ek hi public class as jvm takes public as entry point so multiple public
to kaise vo entry pt dekhega
