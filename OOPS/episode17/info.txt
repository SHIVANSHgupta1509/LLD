main bhi ek thread hai
thread dekhne ke liye exception le aao dikh jaegi
interface is better way as isme inheriten ho paegi, dusre me nhi.
par isme ek thread banani padti pehle khud.
not poss to run same thread again, make new obj.
Thread.currentThread() is very imp usse pata chlega konsi thread chl rhu
and ab us thread ka koi bhi method call kra do and obviously static hai.
by default Threads are Thread-0,1,2..
native func means ki java me nhi likha gya maybe CPP me likha gya

ek thread demon only before it is started.
